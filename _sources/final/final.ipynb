No late submissions will be accepted, so be sure to leave plenty of time to submit the link to your project on Canvas. Feel free to upload the link ahead of time so that you don't need to worry about it. \n* Unlike our homeworks, this is an individual assignment. Everyone will need to submit their own original work. \n* Use the _Project Template_ available in the _Project_ folder on Deepnote. \n* Using the Share button at the top right on Deepnote, enable public sharing, and enable Comment privileges. Then submit the created link on Canvas.\n* The primary focus of the project must be on something involving data, and primarily using one or more datasets that weren't covered in Math 10. You can use datasets that are built in to a Python library like Seaborn or scikit-learn, or you can upload the dataset to Deepnote yourself, such as a dataset that you downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), that you got from [openml.org](https://www.openml.org/), or that you got from UC Irvine's own [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). (__Warning.__ Deepnote does not allow datasets larger than 100mb to be uploaded.)\n* The project should clearly build on the Math 10 material. If you‚Äôre an expert in Python material that was not covered in Math 10, you are of course welcome to use that, but the project should use the topics of Math 10 in an essential way (see the rubric below).\n* Answer the questions at the top of the Deepnote template, especially the question regarding whether you want your project posted in the course notes. Here are examples of student projects from [Spring 2023](https://christopherdavisuci.github.io/UCI-Math-10-S23/Proj/StudentProjects.html), examples of student projects from [Fall 2022](https://christopherdavisuci.github.io/UCI-Math-10-F22/Proj/StudentProjects.html), and examples of student projects from [Spring 2022](https://christopherdavisuci.github.io/UCI-Math-10-S22/Proj/StudentProjects.html).\n* Anything that is taken from another source (either the idea for the project or a piece of code, even if you edit that code) should be explicitly referenced with a link. (For example, you could write, ‚ÄúThe configuration of this Altair chart was adapted from [link].‚Äù).","block_group":"7fc4dd19d72143aab7a576192fd93a37"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"289697869f074c2ab4c6ae9b732384f0","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## üíØ Rubric","block_group":"289697869f074c2ab4c6ae9b732384f0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"9feac5e0edfd485e9d23a718b78903a8","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"The following components are required to receive a passing mark on the final project.","block_group":"9feac5e0edfd485e9d23a718b78903a8"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"62bc20270f4e4bad954736a3772e67f6","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":" 1. __Clarity__ Is the project clear and well-organized? Does it use good coding style? Is the code Pythonic (for example, avoiding unnecessary for loops) and DRY (avoiding unnecessary repetition)? Does it explore one or more clearly described datasets, and is it clear where those datasets came from? Use text and markdown throughout the project to help the reader understand what is going on. Is the reasoning clear? (It's fine if you have negative results like, ‚Äúso there is no clear connection between these variables‚Äù. In fact, I prefer those sorts of results as opposed to unbelievable claims.) Give your project a relevant title (like ‚ÄúSpecies of penguins‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúMath 10 project‚Äù).\n 2. __Machine Learning__ Does the project explore the data using a variety of tools from scikit-learn? Does the project refer to essential aspects of data analysis, such as over-fitting, or the importance of a test set, or feature engineering, or the difference between classification and regression?\n 3. __pandas__ Does the project make essential use of pandas to explore the data? Using pandas to read and store the data is not sufficient. It should also be used either to clean the data, or to analyze the data, or for performing feature engineering.\n 4. __Altair__ Does the project include a variety of interesting charts, made using Altair? Do we learn something about the data from these charts?\n 5. __Extra__ Does the project include material that was not covered in Math 10? (This could include different libraries, different machine learning algorithms, or deeper use of the libraries we covered in Math 10. Some possible topics are included in the _Possible Extra Topics_ notebook, but you're very encouraged to choose your own.)\n\n","block_group":"62bc20270f4e4bad954736a3772e67f6"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"b644d9dfafe14f99aeb0e64003014abc","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Advice","block_group":"b644d9dfafe14f99aeb0e64003014abc"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"3c3f3e730fab455d83d6778e47993a72","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"Below you will find some advice about the project.","block_group":"3c3f3e730fab455d83d6778e47993a72"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"fc24d8b59bd644f781d9de994bd218d3","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"* Don't repeat the same technique multiple times unless it's really essential. For example, having one interesting chart and a different less interesting chart is better than having the same interesting chart made for two different datasets. (Of course, if you can find a DRY way to make many related charts, then that's great.)\n* It's easy to spend lots of time trying to find the perfect dataset, but I'd advise against letting this take up too much time. I'd rather you do an interesting analysis of a boring dataset than a less interesting analysis of a super cool dataset.\n* Don't make unreasonable claims. I'd much rather you say \"we didn't see any relationship bewteen A and B\" than try to force a claim that just doesn't seem true.\n* The main point of this project is to show me what you have learned in Math 10 this summer session. If you are already very advanced in python and write your project on topics that weren't covered in our class, that will not necessarily receive a passing grade. \n* Include many markdown cells (possibly very short, just one sentence) explaining what you are doing. (These are different from Python comments.) If you want to use bold text in your markdown cell, surround the text by two underscores `__like this__`. Be sure you're doing this in a markdown cell, as opposed to in a Python comment after a # symbol.\n* This is already written above, but it's worth repeating. Please err on the side of referencing everything. If your project is based on an idea you saw somewhere else, that's totally fine, but include a clear link in your project to the original source. If your project is based on a tutorial, then it will be primarily graded based on what you've added to the tutorial.
