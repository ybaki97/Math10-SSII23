These are a fundamental (maybe the most fundamental) area of modern Machine Learning. If you want to try learning about them, that would be a great extra topic. Fall 2021 used the library TensorFlow (especially using the command from tensorflow import keras). Winter 2022 used the library PyTorch. Overall TensorFlow seems easier to use (but PyTorch teaches some fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming).
