<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This project delves deep into the “Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023” dataset to unearth patterns and preferences of music enthusiasts globally. Initial explorations focused on descriptive statistics, revealing the central tendencies of various song attributes like danceability, energy, and valence. Through data visualization techniques, correlations between these features and streaming numbers were visualized, offering a visual narrative of what possibly makes a song resonate with audiences. Lastly, I attempting to decipher the formula behind a chart-topping hit via machine learning predictions.</p>

<p>Then, we can use Pandas grouping techniques to see which month has highest average monthly streams.</p>
<p>First, filtering out rows with non-numeric characters in the ‘streams’ column. And since the datatype of “streams” is object, we need to convert it to float to complete calculation.

<p>With these scatter plots, viewers are be able to visually inspect the relationship between each feature and streaming numbers. If points align or group in a certain pattern, it can indicate some correlation.</p>
<p>Other than scatter plots, histogram is also a great alternative to help us find songs pattern. We can also use it to visualize the distribution of streaming numbers over different BPM bins. This can give us insights into which BPM ranges are most popular in terms of streaming numbers.</p>

<p>With the top 200 most streamed songs given above, we have found some interesting realtionship between stream numbers and songs’ features. People usually use “hits” to evaluate whether a song is popular or not. Now, we can label each song is as “hits” or “non-hits” based on a threshold (In this case, songs with streams above the 75th percentile could be considered “hits”).</p>
<p>First, transform the streams column into a binary classification problem. Songs above the 75th percentile in terms of streaming numbers were labeled as “hits”(1) and the rest as “non-hits”(0). This simplification allows us to use classification models. Add a new column ‘hit’</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This project primarily focusing on features like danceability, valence, and energy. The visualizations highlighted potential audience preferences, suggesting an inclination towards upbeat tracks in 2023. Monthly data segmentation revealed key periods of music consumption. Importantly, through a regression model, we attempted to predict song popularity based on quantifiable attributes.</p>
